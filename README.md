DataRCT is a protocol that allows data to be transmitted offline, decentralized, and without regard to the connection type to a nearby peripheral device.

It is designed to be used without the knowledge what transport medium is used for transfer. Could be WiFi or Bluetooth. DataRCT always uses the fastest connection possible.
